# WebAudioXML
A proposal for a standardized way of structuring audio node trees for Web Audio API using XML. The specification for WebAudioXML defines how to structure Audio objects in a hierarchical, modular way using XML. For integration in a web-based applica- tion, it requires WebAudioXML.js, a JavaScript li- brary that parses the XML and creates and con- nects all Web Audio nodes into a tree-like struc- ture, called an Audio Graph. The code is open source and freely available for download from GitHub (https://github.com/hanslindetorp/WebAudioXML).
